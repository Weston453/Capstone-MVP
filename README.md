# Budget / Spending Tracker

## IDEA: 

A site where a user can input spending into specific categories as well as set category limits to alert the user of overspending. It will then display the data in a useful way back to the user.

## MVP:
* Create and login to user accounts 
* Add purchases to a spend category
* Databasing user data so data persists 
* Display expenses in visually appealing way

## Future Features:
* Custom spend categories
* Bill payment reminders on a calendar that alerts you to upcoming bills
* Savings goal buckets to track progress
* Mortgage and Investment calculators
