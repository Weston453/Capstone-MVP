# Budget / Spending Tracker

## IDEA: 

A spend tracker/ budgeting application where a user can input spending into specific categories as well as set category limits to alert the user of overspending. It will then display the data in a useful way back to the user.

## MVP:
* Users should be able to create and login to their accounts 
* Input fields to add purchases to a category
*	Database to store user spending so data persists 
*	Ability to display expenses in a helpful way

## Future Features:
*	Ability for the user to create custom spend categories
*	Add bill payment reminders on a calendar that alerts you to upcoming bills
*	Add savings goal buckets to track progress
*	Mortgage and Investment calculators
